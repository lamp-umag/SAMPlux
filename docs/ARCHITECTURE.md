# SAMPlux — Architecture

A walkthrough of how the app is wired, for anyone extending it. Everything is
plain ES modules loaded directly by the browser — there is no build step, so
what you read in `js/` is exactly what runs.

---

## 1. Runtime overview

```
                    surveys/index.json  ──┐
                    surveys/*.json  ───────┤  (fetched at runtime)
                                           ▼
  index.html ──▶ js/main.js ──▶ js/surveyRunner.js ──▶ Firestore
                                       │                responses/{surveyId}/entries
                                       └─▶ js/tasks/{rt,stroop,gonogo}.js
                                              (full-screen overlay, returns result)

  stats.html       ──▶ js/stats.js       ─┐
  admin-stats.html ──▶ js/adminStats.js  ─┼─▶ js/statsCore.js ──▶ Firestore (read)
  admin.html       ──▶ js/admin.js       ─┘   (+ firebaseClient.js everywhere)
```

`js/firebaseClient.js` is imported by every data-touching module and is the only
place the Firebase project is configured.

## 2. The survey runner (`js/surveyRunner.js`)

The runner is a small state machine over a flat array of `items`.

**Lifecycle**

1. `loadSurveyIndex()` reads `surveys/index.json`.
2. The selected survey JSON is fetched and passed through `resolveExtends()`
   (survey inheritance, §4) and the **randomization engine** (§3).
3. Items render one at a time. Each item type has a renderer that draws into the
   `#question` / `#options` / `#controls` slots.
4. On submit, the answers + paradata (§5) are written to Firestore.

**Item types** are dispatched by `item.type`:

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| Display | `info` (sections start their prompt with `SECCIÓN`) |
| Free input | `text`, `email`, `url`, `number`, `phone`, `date`, `time` |
| Choice | `single_choice`, `multi_choice`, `likert`, `yes_no` |
| Scale | `slider`, or any custom type whose name is a key in `optionSets` |
| Cognitive task | `task_rt`, `task_stroop`, `task_gonogo` |

**`optionSets`** let you define a response scale once and attach it to many items
by using the set's name as the item `type`. The runner resolves the labels/codes
from `survey.optionSets[item.type]`.

---

## 3. Randomization engine

Controlled by `survey.settings.randomizeItems`. Order is computed once per
session (Fisher–Yates) and the **actual presented order is saved** on the
response as `presentationOrder`, so order effects remain analysable.

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `false` / absent | Fixed authoring order |
| `within_scale` | Shuffle items sharing the same `scale`; non-scale items and block positions stay fixed |
| `within_section` | Shuffle items inside each `SECCIÓN…` block; the `info` header stays pinned at the top |
| `between_scales` | Shuffle the order of whole scale blocks |
| `between_dimensions` | Shuffle the order of whole `dimension` blocks |

Tag items with `"scale": "wellbeing"` (or `"dimension": "..."`) to group them.
Section headers act as natural boundaries for `within_section`.

---

## 4. Survey inheritance (`extends` + `transforms`)

A survey can derive from another to avoid duplicating large instruments
(e.g. T1 vs T2 of a longitudinal study):

```jsonc
{
  "id": "study_t2",
  "extends": "study_t1.json",
  "transforms": [
    { "type": "removeItemIds", "ids": ["consent_pdf"] },
    { "type": "removeRutQuestions" }
  ]
}
```

Supported transforms: `removeItemIds`, `removeRutQuestions`,
`contactEmailRelocation`, `introConsentPdfReplace`. They run after the base file
is merged and before randomization.

---

## 5. Paradata

Collected in memory during the session and attached to the response on submit.
**It is not a persistent on-device store** — it lives for the duration of the
attempt and is sent with the answers. Fields written to each response document:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `totalTime` | ms from first render to submit |
| `itemTimes` | ms spent per item id |
| `presentationOrder` | the (possibly randomized) order of item ids shown |
| `navBackCount` | number of "← back" navigations |
| `answerChangeCount` | total number of answer changes |
| `answerChangeEvents` | array of `{ itemId, from, to, t }` (capped) |
| `browserData` | userAgent, language, timezone, screen size, referrer |
| `createdAt` | Firestore server timestamp |

Per-item timing is what the stats pages turn into **response-time distributions**
and **speeder detection**.

---

## 6. Cognitive tasks (`js/tasks/`)

Each task exports `async run(container)` and is launched by the runner into a
full-screen overlay (`.task-overlay`) layered above the survey. The overlay sets
`overflow:hidden`, disables text selection, and centres a single stimulus so
there is **no scrolling and no stray text** mid-trial.

- `rt.js` — simple reaction time; tap when the circle turns green. Returns
  `{ trials, summary:{ mean_rt_ms, sd_rt_ms, ... } }`.
- `stroop.js` — colour–word interference; returns congruent/incongruent RTs and
  the Stroop effect.
- `gonogo.js` — response inhibition; returns hit rate, false-alarm rate, RTs.

The summary object is stored as that item's answer, so task metrics export and
chart exactly like any other variable.

`helpers.js` holds shared primitives (`sleep`, `rand`, `shuffle`, `mean`, `pct`).

---

## 7. Stats pages

`statsCore.js` is intentionally **auth-free and theme-agnostic** so both the
public and admin dashboards share one compute/render core: Firestore fetch,
distribution + histogram + summary helpers, duration/number formatters, and
dependency-free SVG/HTML chart renderers.

- **`stats.js` / `stats.html`** — public. Aggregates only: KPIs, submissions
  timeline, total response-time distribution, per-variable distributions,
  cognitive-task summaries. No individual rows, no PII.
- **`adminStats.js` / `admin-stats.html`** — Google-auth gated. Adds per-item
  timing, quantiles, speeder flags, exclusion-flag awareness, and codebook/CSV
  export.

---

## 8. Admin & exclusion flags (`js/admin.js`)

Google login gated by `ALLOWED_EMAILS`. Per survey it offers response counts and
CSV exports (raw / deduplicated / with paradata). **Case review** lets a
reviewer mark a response as excluded; that flag is written to a *separate*
collection so the response document stays untouched:

```
response_export_meta/{surveyId}/flags/{responseId}  →  { excluded: true, reason, ts }
```

Exports and stats read these flags and can drop excluded cases.

---

## 9. Firebase setup

`js/firebaseClient.js` exports `{ app, db }`. To move off the temporary
`sssss-e8013` project:

1. Create a new Firebase project (e.g. `samplux`), add a **Web app**, enable
   **Firestore** and **Google** auth.
2. Paste the web config into `firebaseClient.js`.
3. Firestore rules — minimal shape:
   ```
   match /responses/{surveyId}/entries/{entryId} {
     allow create: if true;          // anonymous participants submit
     allow read, update, delete: if false;  // (admin reads via console / privileged)
   }
   match /response_export_meta/{surveyId}/flags/{id} {
     allow read, write: if request.auth != null
       && request.auth.token.email in [ /* admin emails */ ];
   }
   ```
4. Add admin emails to `ALLOWED_EMAILS` in `admin.js` and `adminStats.js`.

No other file needs to change.

---

## 10. Rollback

SAMPlux is a standalone repo; the original `sssss` is untouched and remains the
ultimate fallback. The first clean release is tagged `v0.1.0`
(`git checkout v0.1.0`). Because both apps share the same engine, fixes port
across with a file copy.
